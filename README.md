# Find and Replace Tool

## Description

The **Find and Replace Tool** is a web-based application built using **Angular** that allows users to paste or type any text and replace specific words or phrases. The tool provides a user-friendly interface with a clean and modern design.

### Features:
- Input area for pasting or typing text.
- Two input fields to specify the word/phrase to find and the word/phrase to replace it with.
- A "Replace" button that performs the find-and-replace operation.
- The replaced text is displayed below the input area.
- Responsive and stylish design for a smooth user experience.

## Assumptions & Improvements
- **Assumptions**: 
  - The tool uses case-insensitive matching for the "Find" text.
  - The replaced text is shown in real-time as soon as the "Replace" button is clicked.
  - The tool works for both single words and phrases.
  
- **Improvements**:
  - Add error handling to display a message if no text is found or if either the "Find" or "Replace" fields are empty.
  - Improve performance for large text inputs (e.g., implement better text processing techniques).
  - Provide an option to replace multiple instances at once or toggle case-sensitive/insensitive matching.
